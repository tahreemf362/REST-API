# REST API Project

This repository contains a **RESTful API** developed as part of the **Node.js and REST API Development Course** by **Simplilearn**.  
The project demonstrates how to create a fully functional API with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and database integration using **MySQL** and **MongoDB**.

---

## üìå Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete data via API endpoints.
- **Database Integration**:
  - **MySQL** for structured relational data
  - **MongoDB** for flexible NoSQL data
- **RESTful Architecture** with properly structured routes
- **Error Handling** and **Validation**
- **Postman Testing** for all endpoints
- **Modular Project Structure** for maintainability

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MySQL**
- **MongoDB**
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## ‚ö° Installation & Usage

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>


## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

npm install

##4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the server

node server.js

Server will start at:

http://localhost:3000


##üì¨ API Endpoints
Here are some example endpoints (adjust according to your routes):

Method	Endpoint	Description

GET	/api/users	Get all users

GET	/api/users/:id	Get user by ID

POST	/api/users	Create new user

PUT	/api/users/:id	Update user by ID

DELETE	/api/users/:id	Delete user by ID

##üß™ Testing with Postman

Open Postman

Import your endpoints or test manually

Ensure your server and databases are running

This project is part of my Simplilearn Node.js and REST API Course Completion.
I gained hands-on experience handling API development, databases, and Postman testing, overcoming multiple errors and learning through practical implementation.
